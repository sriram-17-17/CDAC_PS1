This repository contains my work based on identification of OSCC and Lung Cancer using biomarkers -Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and images.

Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately one in six deaths annually, despite significant advancements in early detection, research, and treatment.

Traditionally, oral cancer screenings have been conducted by dentists during routine checkups. However, expanding these screenings beyond dental practices could help reach individuals who may not receive regular dental care or who belong to high-risk groups.

Thus, detection of cancer through identification of biomarkers present in the breath, saliva and urine of patients and those at high risk is a very safe, reliable and a comparatively inexpensive method.
It has also been found that healthcare professionals can be easily trained to collect satisfactory samples for testing due to the simplicity of the equipment used.

# Project Objectives

- To study and understand the different detection methods for oral and lung cancer using volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are released while breathing.
- To develop a machine learning model to diagnose oral cancer and lung cancer with the help of VOCs that are identified in the breath sample of a patient and images that are provided to us
